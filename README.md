#Coin Countr for Android


Why do it the hard way when there is an easier way? With Coin Countr there is a reduction of human error when counting cash. Instead of adding up the coins in your head or on paper. Simply count the amount of each coin and note that you have and add it into the app, let the app do all the hard work and give you instant feedback.

Sharing with your coworkers or management is easy with this app, simply press the share button to send the total, date and time with any social link you want or simply just save them on your device for later recovery.

Please note that this app is compatible with 4.0+ devices.
